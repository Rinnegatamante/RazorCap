# RazorCap
Simple plugin that allows to perform GPU captures with sceRazorCapture. Works on both retail and devkit.<br>
In order to make it work on retail, you'll need to dump and decrypt librazorcapture_es4.suprx from devkit fw.<br>
Press START+SELECT+LEFT to perform a GPU capture.

Thanks to Bythos for reporting sceRazorCapture as working on retail.
